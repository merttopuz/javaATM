# Java ATM Application
Hi! I'm create a project with Java Swing Library. This project has 3 important functions.
- Withdraw Money
- Deposit Money
- Transfer Money
# Account Password (bank-accounts.txt)
I created a folder which name is assets. Then I added images and datas in this folder. You will look this datas and add new member. But this situation a little different. I created a function and this function apply basic password encryption. If you want to add new member, you write like this in bank-accounts.txt:
**Password: mert
Password Encryption: phuw**
So, each character changes with the next 3 characters.
- m : p
- e : h
- r : u
- t : w
# Accounts
ID: 11111 - Password: 0000
ID: 15152 - Password: mert
ID: 85640 - Password: cbilir
ID: 96425 - Password: 123456
